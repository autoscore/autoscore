Description: Automatically scores orthographic listener transcripts for words correctly identified. 
    This is useful for speech perception research, such as studies examining listener understanding 
    of speech in background noise or disordered speech, as well as clinical disciplines where 
    listener perception of words correct are used to determine intelligibility of client’s speech or 
    their ability to understand speech.
